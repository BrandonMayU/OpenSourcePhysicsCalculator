# OpenSourcePhysicsCalculator
This is an open source physics calculator available for iOS devices. Anyone can make changes to better the app!


As for my physics final I wanted to develop an open source calculator where I would build parts of the projectile motion
portion and other people are invited to build areas of the app that excite them (ex. kinematics). 

# What I learned
I needed to take formulas that where written on paper and convert them into code that is able to run on an iPhone. While I was doing this I was able to have an even more indepth understanding of the formulas and how they work since I need to test the formulas multiple times to get the desired result. One bug I experienced was that Swift by defualt calculates in "Rad Mode" not "Deg Mode" meaning my algorithm was originally off however I was able to fix it and make it run perfectly

# What You Can Do
Want to make high-school physics easier for students? One of the best ways to learn is visually. I have designed this app in a way that allows other people to make pull-requests to create better versions that best serve students.
