# OpenSourcePhysicsCalculator
This is an open source physics calculator available for iOS devices. Anyone can make changes to better the app!


As for my physics final I wanted to develop an open source calculator where I would build parts of the projectile motion
portion and other people are invited to build areas of the app that excite them (ex. kinematics).
